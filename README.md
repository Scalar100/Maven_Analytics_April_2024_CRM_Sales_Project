# Maven_Analytics_April_2024_CRM_Sales_Project
This project utilizes a dataset from the April 2024 Maven Analytics Sales Challenge. It presents an interactive Power BI dashboard tailored for sales managers to monitor their team's quarterly performance. The dashboard offers detailed tracking of performance metrics for managers and sales agents, segmented by sector, product, and location.

### Project Background
The B2B sales of computer hardware play a crucial and evolving role within the technology industry. To maintain a competitive edge, it's essential for businesses to understand sales trends, product performance, and client preferences. Utilizing data-driven insights is key to making informed decisions about inventory management, sales strategies, and targeted marketing.

I am part of **MavenTech**, a company dedicated to providing computer hardware to large enterprises. We fully recognize the power of data analytics to drive our success. Recently, we implemented a new CRM system, which has allowed us to accumulate extensive data on our sales opportunities. However, this data has been largely inaccessible outside the CRM platform.

In the Maven Sales Challenge, I have been tasked with the role of BI Developer. My objective is to assist MavenTech in becoming a truly data-driven organization. To achieve this, I will create an interactive dashboard designed to give our sales managers clear and actionable insights into their teams' quarterly performance. This tool will enable them to optimize their sales strategies, make better-informed decisions, and ultimately drive better business outcomes.

### Tools and Technologies Used
1. **Power BI**: The primary tool used in this project was Power BI, which facilitated the creation of visualizations and dashboards to extract and display insights from the data. I also utilized the Power BI service, enabling the generation of an interactive web link for seamless navigation and interaction with the report.
2. **Power Query Editor**: An advanced feature of Power BI, Power Query Editor was employed for data transformation and cleaning. This tool was used to perform various operations such as removing duplicates, eliminating blank rows, formatting columns, and replacing values across different columns.
4. **Microsoft Excel**: Microsoft Excel played a crucial role at the beginning of the project. It helped in the understanding of the the data structure, some light data cleaning and also served as a guide for subsequent data transformations using the Power Query Editor.
   
### Data Model
The data model was generated automatically in Power BI. It automatically detected the relationships and cardinality between the various tables used in this project.

### Data Collection
The data for this project was obtained from the official **Maven Analytics** website. It includes sales opportunities from various accounts, encompassing multiple regions and industries. The dataset provides key metrics such as account details, product information, sales team data, and the status of each sales opportunity, as outlined in the data overview above.
