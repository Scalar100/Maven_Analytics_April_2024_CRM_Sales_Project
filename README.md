# Maven_Analytics_April_2024_CRM_Sales_Project
This project utilizes a dataset from the April 2024 Maven Analytics Sales Challenge. It presents an interactive Power BI dashboard tailored for sales managers to monitor their team's quarterly performance. The dashboard offers detailed tracking of performance metrics for managers and sales agents, segmented by sector, product, and location.

## Project Background
The B2B sales of computer hardware play a crucial and evolving role within the technology industry. To maintain a competitive edge, it's essential for businesses to understand sales trends, product performance, and client preferences. Utilizing data-driven insights is key to making informed decisions about inventory management, sales strategies, and targeted marketing.

I am part of **MavenTech**, a company dedicated to providing computer hardware to large enterprises. We fully recognize the power of data analytics to drive our success. Recently, we implemented a new CRM system, which has allowed us to accumulate extensive data on our sales opportunities. However, this data has been largely inaccessible outside the CRM platform.

In the Maven Sales Challenge, I have been tasked with the role of BI Developer. My objective is to assist MavenTech in becoming a truly data-driven organization. To achieve this, I will create an interactive dashboard designed to give our sales managers clear and actionable insights into their teams' quarterly performance. This tool will enable them to optimize their sales strategies, make better-informed decisions, and ultimately drive better business outcomes.
